      'The service is excellent. All you need to do is just to leave the knives at your doorstep in the morning and they will all be back in original sharpness in the morning next day. So convenient, pick up and delivery are FOC, and they only charge $15 per knife!',

    comment: 'Exceptional Knife Sharpening Service â€“ Like Factory New! I recently entrusted this company with 11 of my cherished Global knives, and I couldnâ€™t be more impressed with the results. These knives are the heart of my kitchen and see heavy daily use, so I was a bit nervous handing them over. But wowâ€”when they were returned, they looked and felt almost like they had just come out of the factory!',
