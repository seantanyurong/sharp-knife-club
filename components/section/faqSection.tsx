            We use a belt sharpener. Precision is our top priority – we take great care in ensuring the angle is
            optimal. This approach ensures not only the sharpest edge but also minimizes the amount of metal
            removed, prioritizing the longevity of your blades.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            To guarantee optimal performance, we will test every knife on paper to ensure it slices
            effortlessly. Your satisfaction and the functionality of your blades are of utmost importance to us.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            If requested, we can use ultra fine diamond whetstones. You will be able to choose the angle.
            Finishing and stropping will be up to 50,000 grit. However, there will be an additional charge of
            $20/knife.

        Yes. We hand-sharpen serrations with precision tools to maintain their original shape and cutting performance. 
        This process is more time-intensive than sharpening a straight edge, so a small additional fee applies.

        For most home cooks, sharpening every 3–6 months keeps knives performing at their best. 
        If you cook daily, prepare large amounts of food, or often cut through harder ingredients like squash or bone-in meat, 
        you may benefit from sharpening more frequently to maintain safety and efficiency.
