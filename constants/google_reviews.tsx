    comment: 'Exceptional Knife Sharpening Service â€“ Like Factory New! I recently entrusted this company with 11 of my cherished Global knives, and I couldnâ€™t be more impressed with the results. These knives are the heart of my kitchen and see heavy daily use, so I was a bit nervous handing them over. But wowâ€”when they were returned, they looked and felt almost like they had just come out of the factory!',
