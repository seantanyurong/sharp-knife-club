Knives **“chip”** when a piece of metal breaks out from the edge, leaving a nick or missing section.  This can happen if the blade hits something very hard (a bone, a ceramic plate, a metal fastener, or even a glass cutting surface) or is misused as a prying tool.  Experts note that chips often occur during impact or from cutting overly hard or frozen foods.  In humid or acidic conditions, even stainless steel can pit and chip: moisture and acids left on a blade can weaken it over time and cause tiny “micro-corrosion” chips.  The seriousness of a chip depends on its size.  **Minor chips** (well under 1–2 mm) may only show up as roughness, while **medium chips** (a few millimeters) can catch food or snag when slicing.  **Large chips** (several millimeters) can drastically shorten the cutting edge and ruin fine cutting tasks.  In general, bigger chips interrupt the smooth slicing action of a knife and must be ground away to restore performance.

To repair a chip, a sharpener must **remove the damaged steel** and create a new edge. The basic steps are as follows:

- **Inspect and mark the chip.** First the chip and surrounding area are examined. A sharpener checks how deep the chip is and draws a guideline matching the original blade contour beyond the chip.
- **Grind out the chip (coarse abrasion).** Using a coarse abrasive (often a 220–400 grit stone or belt), the tech grinds the blade until the chip is gone and only fresh metal remains. This usually means grinding **past the tip or edge** until no damaged steel is left.
- **Reprofile the edge geometry.** Next, the technician thins the knife behind where the edge was removed. This involves reshaping the bevel so that the new edge blends smoothly into the old profile. In practice, the entire edge may need a slight thinning so the repaired section matches the rest of the blade.
- **Refine with finer grits.** After all chips are removed, the blade is moved to progressively finer stones (800–1000 grit and above) to **smooth the new bevel**. Care is taken to keep the angle consistent across the blade. Any small nicks or rolls are honed out so the edge is uniform.
- **Polish and hone.** Finally, stropping or fine abrasive (3000–8000 grit) is used to polish the metal at the very edge. This finishes the repair by removing the burr (wire edge) and producing a keen, sharp edge. The goal is a smooth, clean apex with no visible jagged bits. Often, a **test cut** (paper or soft vegetable) is done at the end to confirm the knife cuts evenly.

Each of the above steps may be repeated multiple times, especially on stubborn or large chips.  Very small chips might be handled by hand-sanding or light stropping, but medium-to-large chips usually require power tools.  If the chip is extremely large or deep, professional repair (with belt grinders and fixtures) is recommended to avoid thinning the blade unevenly.  In short, **chip repair is essentially a controlled re-sharpening:** remove damaged metal, re-establish the grind, and refine the edge.

Chip repair **reduces blade life** because each repair cuts away steel.  Sharpening (and especially chip removal) always **shortens and widens** the edge profile.  For example, one expert notes that every time you grind away a chip, “the blade’s edge geometry becomes wider” and it takes a bit more material removal to restore a sharp edge.  In practical terms, fixing a chip makes the knife’s profile lower and slightly thicker behind the edge.  Over many repairs, the cutting length of the blade is reduced, and the angle of the very tip may change.  The blade will generally need more frequent touch-ups afterward, since the repaired section forms a *new* thinner edge.

The steel type also affects how a chip is fixed.  **High-carbon steels** (no rust-resistant alloying) are very hard and take an edge easily, so they can become razor-sharp again with less effort.  However, they **corrode readily**, and any rust or “patina” left on them can actually propagate chips.  If a carbon steel blade chips and rust has set in, the weakened steel may crack more easily.  In contrast, **stainless steels** contain chromium and other hardening elements; they resist rust but often contain hard carbide particles.  These carbides give stainless blades *great edge retention* but make them **slower to grind out**.  In practice, a stainless knife (especially a high-vanadium “supersteel”) will require more work on grinders or diamond stones to remove a chip than an equivalent carbon blade. Ceramic blades (not metal at all) chip even more easily, and repairing them often means a complete re-profile with diamond abrasives.

In summary, repairing a chip involves careful material removal and re-profiling.  Small chips can be ground out on coarse stones; larger chips often require expert tools.  Every chip repair shortens the blade and alters its geometry, so excessive repairs will eventually dull the knife’s performance.  Finally, the steel’s hardness and composition play a role: harder, carbide-rich steels hold edge longer but take more aggressive abrasives to fix, whereas softer carbon steels can be sharpened faster but corrode if not kept clean.
